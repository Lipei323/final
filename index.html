        <p class="p">
          During the Soviet era, the relationship between Russia and Ukraine was akin to that of siblings born of the
          same parents. Both nations share a common Slavic heritage and roots and are ethnically Eastern Slavic peoples,
          with significant strength in their own right. However, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991,
          the two siblings went their separate ways, and underlying tensions gradually surfaced.
